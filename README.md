### Project 1: Exploration of weather trends over time: World vs. Denmark

This project demonstrates several found trends in the fluctuations of the average weather temperature of the world in the time interval between the years 1750 to 2013, compared with the local yearly average temperature in Copenhagen, Denmark, where I am currently living in.

### Project 2: Investigating medical appointment patient arrival factors in Brazil

As medical clinics all over the world have experienced, patient arrival at their scheduled appointments is not guaranteed. Moreover, it seems hard for the medical personnel to explain what are the reasons behind such behaviour.

This data analysis project aims to describe some possible factors behind patient absence from scheduled appointments in Brazil, using descriptive statistics upon a dataset of 100.000+ medical appointments collected from various medical clinics in Brazil's many neighbourhoods.

### Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists to test changes on a web page by running an experiment where a control group sees the old version, while the experiment group sees the new version. A metric (in our case, the "converted" rate) is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from users in each group. These results are then used to judge whether one version is more effective than the other.

An e-commerce company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Through this notebook, the company's decision will be tested to let the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

This project will analyze the statistical likelihood of increasing conversion rates due to a newer version of the landing page, and will consolidate and validate its results by demonstrating the same statistical effects using three statistical methods: probability, hypothesis testing, and, lastly, logistic regression.

### Project 4: Data Wrangling and Analysis of Twitter-based content 
#### (Udacity-exclusive case study: WeRateDogs archive)

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it; a process also known as data wrangling.

The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ["they're good dogs Brent"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent). WeRateDogs has over 7.5 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive for Udacity students exclusively to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
