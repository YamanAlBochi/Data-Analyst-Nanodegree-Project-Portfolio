# Data Analyst Nanodegree: Project Portfolio
A collection of all the module projects analyzed for the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

### Project 1: Exploration of weather trends over time: World vs. Denmark

This project demonstrates several found trends in the fluctuations of the average weather temperature of the world in the time interval between the years 1750 to 2013, compared with the local yearly average temperature in Copenhagen, Denmark, where I am currently living in.

### Project 2: Investigate a Dataset
For this project I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigated it using NumPy and Pandas. The database I investigated was about medical appointment no show. The database contained 300k medical appointments and its 15 variables (characteristics) of each. The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show the appointment. To answer some questions using this database I had to go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.

After completing the project, I felt comfortable with:

- Knowing all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Knowing how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use.
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis.
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings.
