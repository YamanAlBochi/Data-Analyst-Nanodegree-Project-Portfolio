### Project 2: Investigating medical appointment patient arrival factors in Brazil

As medical clinics all over the world have experienced, patient arrival at their scheduled appointments is not guaranteed. Moreover, it seems hard for the medical personnel to explain what are the reasons behind such behaviour.

This data analysis project aims to describe some possible factors behind patient absence from scheduled appointments in Brazil, using descriptive statistics upon a dataset of 100.000+ medical appointments collected from various medical clinics in Brazil's many neighbourhoods.
